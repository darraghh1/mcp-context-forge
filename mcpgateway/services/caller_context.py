"""CRUD caller context for authorization decisions (Phase A T20 hardening).

A dedicated, named sentinel for the "this code path runs as the system,
NOT as an authenticated user" escape hatch in CRUD-authorization helpers.
Replaces the earlier pattern where both ``caller_user_email`` and
``caller_token_teams`` being ``None`` was the bypass condition — Momus
(plan critique, this session) flagged the two-Nones magic as
"under-specified for production" because:

- Any caller that *forgot* to thread auth context (mid-stack bug,
  middleware failure, refactor regression) would silently hit the
  bypass.
- A reviewer reading the call site cannot tell from the API whether
  the bypass was intentional or accidental.

Metis (architectural review, same session) independently flagged that
:mod:`mcpgateway.services.import_service` calls
:meth:`ServerService.register_server` without caller context (lines
818 and 846), meaning a non-admin import path could associate any A2A
agent with any server regardless of the importer's visibility scope.

This module fixes both problems by making the bypass **explicit and
named**: callers must opt in via :meth:`CallerContext.system` rather
than fall in by forgetting parameters. Route handlers construct
:meth:`CallerContext.for_user` from the authenticated request, which
makes any missing-context bug observable as a *type error* rather
than a silent privilege escalation.

Usage at user-facing routes:

.. code-block:: python

    caller = CallerContext.for_user(user_email, token_teams)
    await server_service.register_server(db, server_in, caller_context=caller)

Usage at internal / bootstrap / seed / import paths (after explicit
sign-off that the path is admin-only or runs as platform):

.. code-block:: python

    # IMPORT path: admin-only endpoint, intentionally bypasses CRUD auth.
    # If the import endpoint ever opens to non-admin users, thread real
    # caller context through and remove this comment.
    await server_service.register_server(
        db, server_in, caller_context=CallerContext.system()
    )

The CRUD-authorization helpers check :attr:`CallerContext.is_system`
to decide whether to skip the policy evaluation. The two-Nones pattern
is gone.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CallerContext:
    """Authenticated caller identity for CRUD-authorization decisions.

    Construct via the factories — direct instantiation works but bypasses
    the intent signals that the factories give the reader:

    - :meth:`CallerContext.for_user` documents "this is a real
      authenticated user from a route handler".
    - :meth:`CallerContext.system` documents "this is the system / a
      bootstrap pathway intentionally bypassing user auth".

    The :attr:`is_system` attribute is the **only** condition that
    skips CRUD authorization. Missing ``user_email`` alone does NOT
    bypass — a real anonymous user gets a real authorization check
    (which they would correctly fail for non-public resources). The
    bypass is opt-in, not opt-out.

    Attributes:
        user_email: The caller's authenticated email, or ``None`` for
            anonymous / system contexts.
        token_teams: The caller's JWT-scoped team membership list.
            ``None`` means "JWT did not carry a teams claim" (anonymous
            or admin-context); ``[]`` means "public-only token"; a
            non-empty list means "team-scoped token".
        is_system: ``True`` only when constructed via
            :meth:`CallerContext.system`. Authorization helpers
            interpret this as an explicit opt-in bypass.
